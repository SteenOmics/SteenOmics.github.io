                    <p><strong>The keratin issue</strong></br>
                        Keratin contamination is almost always observed as a background protein. Wear only
                        nitrile gloves and rinse with HPLC grade water all trays, containers and surfaces that
                        contact the gel (including gloves, staining trays, scalpels, razor blades, light box,
                        and cutting area).</p>
                    <p> It is strongly suggested to use freshly prepared solutions/buffers for the samples to be
                        submitted to mass spectrometric analysis.</p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Other contaminations</strong></br>
                        Other commonly observed contaminating proteins are caseins and BSA from dry milk, media
                        and/or sera commonly used in biology labs. These protein contaminations can be greatly
                        minimized by extensive washing of cell pellets, glass ware and trays.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    Other contamination can be caused polymers from detergents, PPG and/or PEG. Thus, no
                    detergents should be present in samples to be digested for mass spectrometric analysis.
                    It should be noted, that many soaps and hand creams contain PEG's such that touching
                    tubes, trays or gels with freshly washed or creamed hands can give rise to polymer
                    contaminations.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>For in-solution digests and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis, the sample should be free of
                        ANY detergents (SDS, Triton X100, NP-40, etc.pp.). Once that is insured, the following protocol
                        can be used:

                        The pH of the solution should be adjusted such that the pH lies between 7.2 and 8.5.

                        Trypsin is added to the sample solution such that the enzyme to substrate ratio is in the 1:50
                        to 1:10 range.

                        Incubate for 4 to 8 hours at 37°C. If denaturing, reduction of the SS-bonds, and alkylation of
                        the free thiol groups is necessary, we suggest the following protocol:

                        Precipitate the proteins (see below)

                        Re-dissolve the proteins in 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 20 mM DTT.

                        Incubate for 30 min at 56°C.

                        Cool down to room temperature.

                        Add iodoacetamide solution to a final concentration of 100 mM and incubate for 20 min at room
                        temperature in the dark.

                        Dialyze the solution against 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate using e.g. the Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis
                        MINI units from Pierce (MWCO 3500) overnight.

                        Depending on the protein concentration, either directly add trypsin to the sample solution such
                        that the enzyme to substrate ratio is in the 1:50 to 1:10 range, or speedvac the sample,
                        re-dissolve the proteins in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with the appropriate amount of trypsin
                        present.

                        Incubate for 4 to 8 hours at 37°C.</p>

                    Omit the sodium acetate.

                    </header>
                    <p>There are numerous different staining methods available that are compatible with subsequent
                        proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. Most of them are based on Coomassie
                        stainig, silver staining or staining with fluorescence dyes such as Sypro Ruby or Sypro Orange.
                        Whereas Coomassie staining is easy and cheap, the sensitivity is sometimes insufficient. Silver
                        staining overcomes the sensitivity limitations of Coomasssie staining, but is rather cumbersome.
                        The ease of Coomassie staining and the sensitivity of silver staining are combined in
                        fluorescence Sypro dyes. Those, however, have the disadvantage that they are rather expensive, a
                        fluorescence scanner is a prerequisite for imaging, and excising the gel plugs/bands of interest
                        requires e.g. handheld UV lamps. Irrespective of the staining method used, it is crucial not to
                        irreversibly fix the proteins in the gel during staining; this consideration especially applies
                        to some 'traditional' silver staining protocols that use glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde for
                        fixing and developing which will render the gels incompatible with subsequent mass spectrometric
                        analysis. A variety of mass spec compatible silver staining protocols are given below.</p>
                    <p>
                        We have good experience with numerous commercial Coomassie staining kits including GelCode Blue
                        Stain from Pierce, Bio-Rad's Bio-Safe Coomassie stain and the Colloidal Blue Staining kit from
                        Invitrogen. A general Coomassie staining protocol is given below. If commercial kits are used,
                        we strongly suggest following the manufacturer's protocols.</p>

                            portion.</li>

                        <li> When a sufficient degree of staining has been obtained, quench staining by discarding the
                            developing solution and replacement with 1 % acetic acid.</li>

                        <li> Wash the gel with 1 % acetic acid several times and store in the same solution.</li>

                        <li> Alternatively, the gel can be stored in 0.02 % NaN3 (sodium azide) in ddH2O.</li>

                        NOTE: In some cases the color of the stained protein bands might slightly change in time.
                        However these changes do not affect the results of mass spectrometric sequencing
